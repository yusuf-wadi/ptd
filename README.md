# (P)lan (T)he (D)ay
## A CLI to intuitively and efficiently plan and view your day

## Why

I felt as though I needed a tool that I could quickly refer to, with no heavyweight interface, to see what I needed when I needed it.  

## Usage
For testing: clone and run from dir
```
python src/ptd.py [args]
```
Until actual package release

## TODO:
&#9744; Squash current -c -u bugs  
&#9744; Make slightly more stylized output (timeline view)  
&#9744; Make a python package for app
